This repository is for my RPGTest game. The game is a Final Fantasy type RPG. 
It is leaning more toward Final Fantasy 1 through 3. It's my first attempt at
and RPG.

1st change: Fixed tile map rendering and updated text files to position tiles 
	    correctly. Added NPC. Also made npc move a little, although the 
	    movement is jumpy. Will figure out a way to fix soon.

2nd change: Added World map. Can transition between that and town map(though 
            the code to do this is terrible and will be replaced as soon as 
            collision is added.) Also updated Tile class, not quite finished 
            with that part. Tried adding a method to detect what type of tile 
            the player is on. Added a 2nd layer to the world map(it has only 
            one town on it at the moment.)
