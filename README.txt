This repository is for my RPGTest game. The game is a Final Fantasy type RPG. 
It is leaning more toward Final Fantasy 1 through 3. It's my first attempt at
and RPG.

1st change: Fixed tile map rendering and updated text files to position tiles 
	    correctly. Added NPC. Also made npc move a little, although the 
	    movement is jumpy. Will figure out a way to fix soon.
